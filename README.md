# The `musicography` package: Symbols for Music Writing with `pdflatex`

This package makes available the most commonly used symbols in writing about
music in a way that can be used with `pdflatex` and looks consistent and
attractive. (It also works with `xelatex`.)
It includes accidentals, meters, and notes of different rhythmic values.
The package provides a flexible, user-friendly interface written using `xparse`.

The package requires the `musixtex` fonts.
